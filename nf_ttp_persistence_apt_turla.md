| T1543.003 | Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service | [Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003/) |

#### Description
Detects the creation of a service named `WerFaultSvc` which seems to be used by the SNAKE malware as a persistence mechanism, as described by CISA in their report.

#### Risk
The detection covers persistence mechanisms that involve creating malicious Windows services, allowing attackers to maintain access on compromised systems.

## Queries

### Query 1 - Detect SNAKE Malware Service Persistence via Security Events

#### Query Information
This query detects the creation of a service named `WerFaultSvc` by monitoring security event logs, particularly focusing on service creation under `Service Control Manager`.
```KQL
SecurityEvent 
| where (Provider_Name =~ 'Service Control Manager' and EventID == 7045) 
| where ServiceName contains 'WerFaultSvc' 
| where ImagePath startswith 'C:\Windows\WinSxS\' and ImagePath endswith '\WerFault.exe'
```
#### Query 2 - Detect SNAKE Malware Service Persistence via Device Events
This query monitors DeviceEvents to detect service installations involving WerFaultSvc using Snake malware by inspecting the installed service metadata.

```KQL
DeviceEvents
| where ActionType =~ "ServiceInstalled"
| extend AdditionalData = parse_json(AdditionalFields)
| extend ServiceName = (AdditionalData).ServiceName
| extend ServiceType = (AdditionalData).ServiceType
| extend ServiceStartType = (AdditionalData).ServiceStartType
| extend ServiceAccount = (AdditionalData).ServiceAccount
| where ServiceName contains 'WerFaultSvc' 
| where FolderPath startswith 'C:\Windows\WinSxS\' and FileName =~ '\WerFault.exe'
```

| where FolderPath startswith 'C:\Windows\WinSxS\' and FileName =~ '\WerFault.exe'
```
### Query 3 - Alternative Detection via Registry Events
#### Query Information
Another query for detecting registry changes related to the WerFaultSvc service, monitoring registry paths used by the Snake malware for persistence.

```KQL
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where RegistryKey endswith @"SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\WerFaultSvc"
```

### Query 4: SNAKE Malware Covert Store Registry Key
### Description: 
Detects any registry event that targets the key 'SECURITY\Policy\Secrets\n' which is a key related to SNAKE malware as described by CISA

```KQL
