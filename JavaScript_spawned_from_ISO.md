`//Detection opportunity: JavaScript .js files executing from optical disc image ISOs
//The following detection analytic identifies .js files executing from drives other than the default C:\ drive. Malware such as Qbot can be introduced through ISOs that contain malicious .js files. It is rare for .js files to execute from a drive other than the default drive.
