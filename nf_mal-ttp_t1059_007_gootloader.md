| T1059.007 | Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell | [Command and Scripting Interpreter: JavaScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007/) |

#### Description
This detection rule identifies instances where the Windows Script Host (`wscript.exe`) is executing a JavaScript (`.js`) file from the user's `AppData` folder. It aims to detect instances where a user may have unintentionally executed malicious content by opening a file associated with Gootloader.

#### Risk
This detection helps identify potential execution of malicious scripts from a userâ€™s `AppData` folder, a common tactic for malware such as Gootloader. This behavior is a common sign of an initial compromise, often leading to further infection or data exfiltration.
